All XL Scripts products come with **Complete Theme Support** by default.

XL Scripts allows Anyone to **Create** &amp; **Distribute** themes for any Product. Developing themes for XL Scripts Products does not require any extensive knowledge of PHP.

You will be able to split your themes up-into small chunks using the power of **Templating**. Helper functions are provided to Include different Templates &amp; Assets inside your theme.

Each theme is completely encapsulated into it's own **Directory**. This directory includes all the **Templates** and **Assets** used by the theme. Themes can includes assets from the public folder as-well as the theme directory.

All themes are placed inside the `root/application/views/themes/` Directory. Themes may be uploaded using FTP, or using the **Theme Uploader** inside the Admin Panel.
